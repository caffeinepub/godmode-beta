    "Position the system as behavior/decision guidance (statistical nudging) rather than literal reality manipulation.",
    "App architecture requires multi-source real-time data ingestion (wearables/biometrics, ambient/environmental, social/sentiment, mobility/crowd proxies) feeding a recommendation engine.",
    "Include an uncertainty/risk model to support Event Drift probabilities, Inject Uncertainty mode, and Probability Debt/Reality Pressure trade-offs.",
    "Support both individual-level guidance sessions and aggregated city-level analytics for Timeline Fracture effects."
